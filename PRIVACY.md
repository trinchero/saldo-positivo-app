## Introduction

Saldo+ ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use our mobile application ("App").

By using Saldo+, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## How We Use Your Information

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage Only

**All your data is stored exclusively on your device.** We do not transmit, upload, or sync your data to any external servers, cloud services, or third-party platforms.

Your data is stored using:
- **UserDefaults** (via App Group: `group.com.vintuss.SaldoPositivo`) for expenses, budgets, and settings
- **SwiftData** (Apple's local database framework) for persistent storage
- **iOS App Group** for secure data sharing between the main app and widget extension

### Security Measures

- All data is encrypted using iOS's built-in encryption mechanisms
- Data access is restricted to the app and its extensions (widgets) only
- No network connectivity is required or used for data storage
- Your financial information never leaves your device

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

**We do not share, sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to any third parties.**

Specifically:
- No data is sent to external servers
- No analytics or tracking services are used
- No advertising networks receive your data
- No third-party services have access to your information
- No cloud backup or sync services are utilized

### App Extensions

Your data may be accessed by:
- **Widget Extension**: Reads expense and budget data to display summaries on your home screen
- **Siri Intents Extension**: Allows adding expenses via Siri Shortcuts

Both extensions operate within the same secure App Group container and do not transmit data externally.

## User Rights and Control

## Data Retention

Your data is retained on your device until you:
- Delete individual entries
